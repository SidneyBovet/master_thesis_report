\begin{abstract}

With the rise of consumer-grade Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, high quality VR equipment now no longer is only accessible to research institutes or universities but to the general public as well. This opens up a lot of possibilities.

One of these opportunities appears to be in the field of stroke rehabilitation. Due to a temporary lack of oxygen in parts of the brain, a stroke may result in partial paralysis of a limb. In such a case the rehabilitation process is long, tedious, and often demotivating. The way we currently treat this condition is through exercises and movements of the affected limb, hence making use of neuroplasticity in order to fully recover the original range of motion. This process however is really demotivating, because the patients are forced to face their handicap. We however believe that there is a simple, yet effective solution that will help stroke patients stay motivated, and that is by providing them with a VR game that transposes and amplifies their movements in a virtual environment.

In the past few years, huge improvements have been achieved in the area of motion capture. New techniques allow for instance to reflect skin-to-skin contacts more precisely than ever, such as the Egocentric Coordinate formalism. We propose a modification of this coordinate system in order to apply a distortion to the movements of a tracked performer, while preserving self-haptic consistency. In other words, we introduce a way to create an application in which, when patients touch their skin the virtual avatar does so as well, but when they lift their hand \SI{10}{\centi\meter} above the surface of the skin, the avatar may show a \SI{20}{\centi\meter} gap if a doubling distortion is applied.

We also propose an experiment in order to understand how well we accept a movement distortion, which is key here because we do not want patients to detect the distortion, or at least not too heavily. Indeed, the goal is to keep them motivated at a reaching task of some sort, but if their eyes constantly remind them that what they see is not what they achieve, we might loose the motivating effect we are looking for.

This work therefore tries to build upon the foundations of the field of amplified embodied interactions, and we hope to see more research in this area, which surely will result in dramatic improvement in terms of treatment time and life quality for stroke patients, as well as for VR experiences in general.

I would like first of all to thank Dr.\ Ronan Boulic for giving me the opportunity to work on this project, not only as a Master student at the time of writing this, but also as a Research Assistant in a few months. I further thank him for his supervision, support, and guidance during this project. My thanks also go to Prof.\ St{\'e}phane Gobron, who has accepted to assist Dr.\ Boulic in reviewing and grading the present report. I am proud to defend my Master Thesis in front of these people.

I also wish to thank Eray Molla and Henrique Debarba, who have provided valuable and continuous support in their respective areas of expertise as former lab members, and I wish good luck to Thibault for his future research work.

On a more personal note, I wish to express my gratitude to Alexandre, John, and Thomas for the countless hours of philosophical discussions about theoretical computer science and physics, and additionally to Florian, Fabien and Ga{\"e}l for the numerous sessions of frenzy dice-rolling. Likewise, I take the opportunity to thank Mathieu, Zhivka, and Joanna for the various project I had the chance to work on alongside these talented computer scientists. My thanks also go to Joss, Ogier, Yann, and Maxime for their moral support and enjoyable company---at Sat among other places.

To conclude I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Thierry, Dora, Johanna, and No{\'e}mie for their flawless support. I am greatly indebted to these people.
