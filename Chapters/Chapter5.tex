\section{Set of Tools}

--Mention of the issues encountered with the set of tools when used in live conditions, along with a link to the other video--

As briefly mentioned towards the end of Section \refsec:reachableSphere}, the code base used in this project, and particularly the retargeting part implementing the whole Egocentric Coordinate formalism, is problematic. Although well formated and making use of carefully chosen variable names, the code is intrinsically complex and has sadly been poorly documented and commented.
